            </ul>
            <p>
                Upon termination, your right to use the App will immediately cease. All provisions of these Terms
                that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including ownership provisions,
                warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
            </p>

            <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of your jurisdiction,
                without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or Lumen Guard shall first be attempted
                to be resolved through good faith negotiations. If negotiations fail, disputes may be resolved
                through binding arbitration or in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time at our sole discretion. If a
                revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
                What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
                By continuing to access or use Lumen Guard after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound
                by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the App.
            </p>

            <h2>Severability</h2>
            <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining
                provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be replaced with
                a valid provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision.
            </p>

            <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by us,
                constitute the entire agreement between you and Beans & Brackets regarding your use of Lumen Guard,
                and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.
            </p>
